# Machine-Learning-Meetups

Welcome to the MSBA Kaggle Notebook Collaboration repository! This repository is created to facilitate collaborative writing of Kaggle notebooks by students in the MSBA program at The University of Texas at Dallas.

## About

The goal of this initiative is to enhance everyone's profiles by working together on various topics related to data science and machine learning. We aim to cover topics such as classification, regression, time series analysis, linear and non-linear models, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, Streamlit, Gradio, and utilizing GPUs for machine learning tasks.
